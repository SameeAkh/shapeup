		<p>Stress Relief
		
			We all encounter stress at one time or another. So it's important to be able to recognize stress and learn how to deal with it.
			
			What is stress?
			
			Stress is the feeling that people have when they are overloaded and struggling to cope with demands. Anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person's well-being can cause stress.
			
			Stress can also be a motivator. It can be essential to survival. The &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; mechanism helps us know when and how to respond to danger. But when this mechanism is triggered too easily, or when there are too many stressors at one time, it can become harmful to a person's mental and physical health.
			
			How to manage your stress
			
			To help manage stress, try the following:
			
			Take a break from what you're doing
			Exercise on a regular basis
			Take time to smile and laugh
			Get support from family and friends
			Meditate</p>

		<h4><a href="diet/index.html">Eat what &rsquo;s right for you</a></h4>
		<p>Why a healthy diet is important Although exercise can help you lose body fat and tone muscles, it's also important to have a healthy diet. In the short term, a poor diet can contribute to stress, tiredness, and the capacity to work. Over time, it may add to the risk of developing some illnesses and health problems such as obesity, tooth decay, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, some cancers, depression, osteoporosis, and type-2 diabetes. You've probably heard the old saying, "you are what you eat." So, to be in shape, you need to eat right.
			What is a healthy diet?A healthy diet is more than eating a salad for lunch or buying fat-free yogurt. A healthy diet is a balanced diet that gives your body the nutrients it needs to function properly. And that means getting the majority of your daily calories from fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins. When should you start? Right now! No matter how old you are, how you've eaten in the past, whether you exercise daily or almost never, the benefits of a healthy diet begin today... if you start today! Where can you find healthy food? Healthy food is available almost everywhere. You just have to plan ahead. Almost all restaurants and grocery stores offer healthy options nowadays. And, although it may be more expensive than unhealthy food, the extra money you spend on buying healthy food will be repaid many times over from a healthy life.</p>
